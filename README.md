🛡️ Just Completed: Introduction to Defensive Security – TryHackMe
Excited to share that I’ve completed the "Introduction to Defensive Security" module on TryHackMe!

This training marks another key step in my cybersecurity journey—especially in the Blue Team domain. Through this module, I explored:

🔹 Core Blue Team concepts
🔹 Defensive strategies and threat detection
🔹 Real-world tools used by defenders (like SIEMs and log analysis)
🔹 The importance of proactive monitoring and incident response

This hands-on experience is perfectly aligned with my current SOC Analyst Internship at Cyber Academy, and it's helping me build the mindset and technical skills needed to detect, respond, and defend against cyber threats in real-world environments.

I'm committed to continuous learning, and every completed module sharpens my skills further for the field.
